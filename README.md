# PORTFOLIO

Hey there ðŸ‘‹, Paula here! Thanks for visiting my portfolio!

## about me

I am a recent grad with a Master's degree in Data Science.
I've worked on both solution-oriented and exploratory projects dealing with diverse data sources.
I've completed projects spanning a breadth of topics, from processing cardiac signals for arrythmia detection in patients with congenital heart disease to analyzing web-scraped news articles with NLP techniques and social science approaches like running focus groups.
My passion lies in building a strong career in data science and AI in order to provide data-driven solutions across myriad domains.

## education

In February 2024, I completed my ðŸŽ“ **M.S. in Data Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)** in Lausanne, Switzerland.
My degree program was very project-oriented and provided me with the hands-on experience I felt had been missing from my education up until this point.
You can check out my **[unofficial transcripts](files/transcripts_EPFL.pdf)**, but the following were some of my favorite and most relevant courses:

* Advanced Algorithms
* Applied Data Analysis

During this two and a half year program, I completed:

* internship @ [Schindler](https://regis.schindler.com/en/epfl-lab.html)
* semester project @ [IDIAP Research Institute](https://www.idiap.ch/en)
* master's thesis @ [EPFL's DLAB](https://dlab.epfl.ch)

In May 2021, I graduated from **[Rice University](https://www.rice.edu)** in Houston, TX with a ðŸŽ“ **B.A. in Computational and Applied Math**.
This program was a lot more theoretical, where I built a strong mathematical foundation in analysis, calculus and statistics.
Here, I learned to do rigorous proofs and built a strong work ethic.
The following were my favorite and most relevant courses at Rice, but you can view my full **[unofficial transcripts](files/Unofficial-Academic-Transcript.pdf.pdf)**:

* Operations Research

During my undergraduate studies, I completed:

* internship @ [IMTEK](https://www.imtek.de)
* O-REU program @ [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html)
* internship @ [Sandia National Labs](https://www.sandia.gov)
* senior design project @ Rice partnering with [Texas Children's Hospital](https://www.texaschildrens.org)

My high school education awoke my passion for STEM and early as it may seem, jump-started my career by building a foundation of curiosity.
I got my ðŸŽ“ **high school diploma**  at Robinson High School in Tampa, FL where I partook in the [International Baccalaureate program](https://www.ibo.org/about-the-ib/).
