## about me

I am a recent grad with a Master's degree in Data Science 🤓.
I've worked on both solution-oriented and exploratory projects dealing with diverse data sources.
I've completed projects spanning a breadth of topics, from processing cardiac signals for arrythmia detection in patients with congenital heart disease to analyzing web-scraped news articles with NLP techniques and social science approaches like running focus groups.
My passion lies in building a strong career in data science and AI in order to provide data-driven solutions across myriad domain.

## bio

I was born in Castelar, Argentina 🇦🇷 and immigrated to the United States 🇺🇸 (specifically Tampa, FL) when I was three years old.
As a result, my first language is technically Spanish but I started learning English at a young age and thus consider myself having two mother tongues.
Since then, I've completed an internship in Germany 🇩🇪 and my master's degree in Switzerland 🇨🇭 due to my love of exploring the world, new cultures, and learning languages.

In fact, I have many extracurricular hobbies and passions that I couldn't live without and inspire some of my personal projects. These include:

* exploring cultures and languages
* reading books, buying books 📚, writing ✍🏼
* bouldering 🧗🏻‍♀️, dancing 💃🏻, working out 🏋🏻‍♀️, yoga 🧘🏻‍♀️
* social justice & politics ⚖️

## education

In February 2024, I completed my 🎓 **M.S. in Data Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)** in Lausanne, Switzerland.
My degree program was very project-oriented and provided me with the hands-on experience I felt had been missing from my education up until this point.
You can check out my **[unofficial transcripts](files/transcripts_EPFL.pdf)**, but the following were some of my favorite and most relevant courses:

* Advanced Algorithms:
* Applied Data Analysis

During this two and a half year program, I completed:

* a six month internship at Schindler Group  
* a semester project with an EPFL professor and the IDIAP Research Institute
* my Master's thesis

In May 2021, I graduated from **[Rice University](https://www.rice.edu)** in Houston, TX with a 🎓 **B.A. in Computational and Applied Math**.
This program was a lot more theoretical, where I built a strong mathematical foundation in analysis, calculus and statistics.
Here, I learned to do rigorous proofs and built a strong work ethic.
The following were my favorite and most relevant courses at Rice, but you can view my full **[unofficial transcripts](files/Unofficial-Academic-Transcript.pdf.pdf)**:

* Operations Research

During my undergraduate studies, I completed:

* an **internship** in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany at the Institute for Microsystems Technology (IMTEK)
* an **O-REU program** at Texas A&M University
* an **internship** at Sandia National Labs
* a **senior design project** partnering with Texas Children's Hospital

My high school education awoke my passion for STEM and early as it may seem, jump-started my career by building a foundation of curiosity.
I got my 🎓 **high school diploma**  at Robinson High School in Tampa, FL where I partook in the International Baccalaureate program.
