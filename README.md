# PORTFOLIO

Hey there, Paula here! Thanks for visiting my portfolio!

## about me

I am a recent grad with a Master's degree in Data Science. I've worked on both solution-oriented and exploratory projects dealing with diverse data sources. I've completed projects spanning a breadth of topics, from processing cardiac signals for arrythmia detection in patients with congenital heart disease to analyzing web-scraped news articles with NLP techniques and social science approaches like running focus groups. My passion lies in building a strong career in data science and AI in order to provide data-driven solutions across myriad domain.

## bio

I was born in Castelar, Argentina and immigrated to the United States :us: (specifically Tampa, FL) when I was three years old. As a result, my first language is technically Spanish but I started learning English at a young age and thus consider myself having two mother tongues. Since then, I've completed an internship in Germany and my master's degree in Switzerland due to my love of exploring the world, new cultures, and learning languages.

In fact, I have many extracurricular hobbies and passions that I couldn't live without and inspire some of my personal projects. These include:

* reading and buying books (I consider these separate hobbies)
* bouldering
* dancing
* writing
* working out
* social justice
* politics

## education

In February 2024, I completed my M.S. in Data Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Lausanne, Switzerland.
My degree program was very project-oriented and provided me with the hands-on experience I felt had been missing from my education up until this point.
You can check out my unofficial transcripts [here](files/transcripts_EPFL.pdf), but the following were some of my favorite and most relevant courses:

* Advanced Algorithms:
* Applied Data Analysis

During this two and a half year program, I completed:

* a six month internship at Schindler Group  
* a semester project with an EPFL professor and the IDIAP Research Institute
* my Master's thesis

In May 2021, I graduated from [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu) in Houston, TX with a B.A. in Computational and Applied Math.
This program was a lot more theoretical, where I built a strong mathematical foundation in analysis, calculus and statistics.
Here, I learned to do rigorous proofs and built a strong work ethic.
My senior design project was my first introduction to data science and its impact.
The following were my favorite and most relevant courses at Rice:

* Operations Research

My high school education awoke my passion for STEM and early as it may seem, jump-started my career by building a foundation of curiosity.
I got my high school diploma at Robinson High School in Tampa, FL where I partook in the International Baccalaureate program.
