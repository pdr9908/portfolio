## about me

Hey there, Paula here! Thanks for visiting my porfolio!

I am a recent grad with a Master's degree in Data Science. I've worked on both solution-oriented and exploratory projects dealing with diverse data sources. I've completed projects spanning a breadth of topics, from processing cardiac signals for arrythmia detection in patients with congenital heart disease to analyzing web-scraped news articles with NLP techniques and social science approaches like running focus groups. My passion lies in building a strong career in data science and AI in order to provide data-driven solutions across myriad domain.

Additionally, I have many extracurricular hobbies that I couldn't live without and inspire some of my personal projects. These include:

* reading and buying books (I consider these separate hobbies)
* bouldering
* dancing
* writing
* working out
* social justice
* politics
